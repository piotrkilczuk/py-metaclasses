Me, learning Python Metaclasses
===============================

The code in this repo assumes you are using Python 3, as the syntax of metaclass definition changed from Python 2.

Each milestone is documented by a separate Python test case, which can be executed this way::

    ./setup.py test

Have as much fun as I had writing this :-)
